                        2.5.1 Make a plan, ordered TODO list 
                                          - Create project dir - done
                                          - Create enviornement - done 
                                          - Install required packages (requests for API comms and Pandas / openpyxl for Excel) - done 
                                          - Decide on an arhitecture
                                                             - the app will be menu-based so it is more easy to use 
                                                             - the app will load 150 licenses from the API endpoint (call the get 5 times) at startup and 
                                                                hold the licenses in a list 
                                                              - the 3 methods requested will each generate a single excel file. 
                                                                            - Does it make sense for them to check if one already exists? -NO 
                                                                                          the app will name each file with the date (seconds included) for an easy way to check between them 
                                                              - if the size of the direcotyr where we save the excel files is greated than some MB we could delete the oldest entry.
                                          - Create barebone app skeleton - done
                                          - Create user UI - done 
                                          - Finish LeftSide API endpoint reading part - done
                                                            - Issues with the key vaalue of the json object that you get from the API- Tested with postman and the name is dataDeExpirare / dataDeEmitere 
                                          
                                          - Finish RightSide - excel creation - done 
                                                           - issues with the datetime format probably, the show only valid licenses not working - bug in the logic found and fixed
                                                           - need to make the column with bigger by default done 
                                                           - change the name of the excels - done 
                                                           - change the name of the columns - done 
                                          - Write unitTests ? not needed / no time
                                          - Test - done
